# Pre-compiled Guacamole Proxy Daemon packages
The repository contains instructions how to compile the Guacamole Proxy Daemon `guacd` to be used by the rport server.

It also contains [ready-to-use binary packages](https://github.com/realvnc-labs/rport-guacamole/releases/tag/1.5.0) for Debian and Ubuntu (x86_64, aarch and armv7)

Go to [the release downloads](https://github.com/realvnc-labs/rport-guacamole/releases/tag/1.5.0) and grab the package for your distribution.

> üö´ **Do not use any of the packages to build a fully featured Guacamole Server!**
>
> The packages are only suitable to run in combination with [rportd](https://github.com/realvnc-labs/rport).

## Install packages on Debian
To install the Guacamole Proxy Daemon from pre-compiled packages, proceed as follows.
```bash
# Resolve dependencies first
apt install libcairo2 libjpeg62-turbo libpng16-16 libfontconfig1 libfreetype6 libfreerdp-client2-2 libssh2-1
# Download the package
. /etc/os-release
curl -LO https://github.com/realvnc-labs/rport-guacamole/releases/download/1.5.0/rport-guacamole_1.5.0_debian_${VERSION_CODENAME}_$(uname -m).deb
# Install
dpkg -i rport-guacamole_1.5.0_debian_${VERSION_CODENAME}_$(uname -m).deb
```

## Install packages on Ubuntu
To install the Guacamole Proxy Daemon from our pre-compiled packages, proceed as follows.
```bash
# Resolve dependencies first
apt install libcairo2 libjpeg-turbo8 libpng16-16 libfontconfig1 libfreetype6 libfreerdp-client2-2 libssh2-1
# Download the package
. /etc/os-release
curl -LO https://github.com/realvnc-labs/rport-guacamole/releases/download/1.5.0/rport-guacamole_1.5.0_ubuntu_${VERSION_CODENAME}_$(uname -m).deb
# Install
dpkg -i rport-guacamole_1.5.0_ubuntu_${VERSION_CODENAME}_$(uname -m).deb
```

To avoid conflicts with a potentially already running instance of `guacd` it's installed to `/opt/rport-guacamole`.
By default, `guacd` listens only on localhost port 9445. To change the port, edit `/etc/default/rport-guacamole`. 

## Update from 1.4.0
To update from 1.4.0 to the latest version, just download the package for your distribution and architecture and install with `dpkg -i <PACKAGE>`.

Because guacd doesn't require a configuration and it doesn't store any data, you can also uninstall and re-install to upgrade your version. 

## Compile and package yourself
If you prefer to compile and package yourself, just execute the scripts of the repository on your machine.

To compile and build the Debian packages quickly, proceed as shown below.
```
export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
git clone https://github.com/realvnc-labs/rport-guacamole.git
cd port-guacamole
sh 01-resolve-debian-dependencies.sh
sh 02-compile-guacamole.sh
sh 03-create-deb.sh
sh 04-lintian.sh
```

### Popular pitfalls

If you compile yourself, heed the following advice:

* `guacd` writes some files on the fly into $HOME. Not all users have a writable home directory. The user `daemon` for example, cannot write files to $HOME.
* The `guacd` sometimes can't find the needed rdp libraries. Pass the library path when starting.

Example:
```bash
HOME=/tmp LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/rport-guacamole/lib /opt/rport-guacamole/sbin/guacd -v
```

The pre-compiled packages ship with a systemd service that does all the above in the background.
